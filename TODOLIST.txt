1. All orderby -> sort
2. I think the if statement in the TradeRegsitrar which checks if the buyer account has associates then we don't register seller is wrong
	we should register both jyuxer.
3. In profitability checker we should consied whether the initial buyer or initial seller is the account we need
4. In that case only registering a single account from start may be done ? -_-
5. Historical downloader contains bugs and it's hard to sync with live trading system
6. Remove code duplications (see TradeRegistrar)
7. Write the actual trader
8. There are some sortings that were depending on the trade Id, that's ridiculous
9. Update fees


10. see the strange output
